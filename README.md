# Distributed-Log-Analytics-Engine


The Distributed Log Analytics Engine processes large-scale system logs in real-time across multiple nodes. It implements distributed data structures and indexing to efficiently query logs for anomalies, error trends, and performance metrics. A MapReduce-style pipeline ensures scalability, enabling parallel log parsing and aggregation from thousands of entries per second. The system supports fault tolerance and load balancing, ensuring high availability even under heavy workloads. This project demonstrates expertise in distributed systems, concurrency, and scalable data processing.
